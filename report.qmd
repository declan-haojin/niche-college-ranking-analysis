# Introduction

## Research Background

Every year, millions of students apply to colleges across the United States, and many of them use college rankings lists from sources such as *US News and World Report*, Forbes.com, and Niche.com to to help them decide where to apply and where to go. In recent years, these lists have been heavily criticized for focusing on "exclusivity and resources, rather than accessibility and economic mobility" (1).The system can also be easily manipulated by a university if that university prioritize certain metrics to raise their rankings, as seen in Northeastern University meteoric rise from #163 to #49 on the US News and World Report list in only 17 years. The president of Northeastern University even explicitly stated that it was a top priority of the university to raise its ranking (2).

\(2\) https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/

These lists are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to the large impact that a college has on a student's life, it is important to know where these rankings come from and what they actually measure. In this project, we will explore how influential different metrics are in determining a college's ranking.

In general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school's ranking on the **Niche College Ranking List** and determine which are most important to a high ranking. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and admission rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren't typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.

For the sake of clarity, when we say a "low rank," we are referring to schools with a lower numerical rank, such as #1 and #2. When we say a "high rank," we a referring to schools with a high numerical rank, such as #499 and #500.

## Data

```{r}
#| label: import

niche_data_500 <- read_csv("data/niche_data_500.csv")
us_dep_of_ed <- read_csv("data/us_dep_of_ed.csv", na = c("NULL", "PrivacySuppressed"))
```

### Data Set #1: Niche

-   The first data set comes from Niche's "2023 Best Colleges in America" list

    (https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/)

-   Niche aggregates data from a variety of sources, including the US Department of Education and reviews from students and alumni, to build their list of college rankings. The rankings list is updated monthly. However, Niche only receives data from the US Department of Education on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.

-   There are `r nrow(niche_data_500)` observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: `college` (institution name) and `rank`.

### Data Set #2: US Department of Education

-   The second data set comes from the US Department of Education's College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States.

    (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)

-   The College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data, but most of the data comes from the 2020-2021 school year. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.

-   There were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don't need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to narrow this to 31 variables. We chose any variables that we thought would have an impact on college rank, and excluded redundant ones like specific breaksdowns of test scores. There are `r nrow(us_dep_of_ed)` observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States.

#### Variable Summary

Here is a summary of the variables we will be using in our analysis. We selected every one we thought could impact rank, but left some out, such as test score breakdowns to avoid redundancy.

Categorical:

-   `college`: Institution name
-   `REGION:` US geographic region (New England, Mid East, Great Lakes, Plains, Southeast, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, Far West, Outlying Areas)
-   `ACCREDAGENCY`: Accreditor for Institution
-   `CONTROL`: Public, Private nonprofit, or Private for-profit
-   `CCBASIC`: Carnegie Classification (basic)

Numerical

-   `ADM_RATE`: Admission rate
-   `UGDS`, `UGDS_WHITE`, `UGDS_BLACK`, `UGDS_HISP`, `UGDS_ASIAN`, `UGDS_AIAN`, `UGDS_NHPI`, `UGDS_2MOR`, and `UGDS_UNKN` represent the enrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students, enrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students who are White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, two or more races, and of unknown race, respectively.
-   `NPT4_PUB`: Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions)
-   `NPT4_PRIV`: Average net price for Title IV institutions (private for-profit and nonprofit institutions)
-   `COSTT4_A`: Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions)
-   `COSTT4_P`: Average cost of attendance (program-year institutions)
-   `AVGFACSAL`: Average faculty salary
-   `PCTPELL`: Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant
-   `C150_4`: Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)
-   `AGE_ENTRY`: Average age of entry
-   `FEMALE`: Share of female students
-   `MARRIED`: Share of married students
-   `FIRST_GEN`: Share of first-generation students
-   `FAMINC`: Average family income
-   `MD_FAMINC`: Median family income
-   `ENDOWBEGIN`: Value of school's endowment at the beginning of the fiscal year
-   `SAT_AVG`: Average SAT equivalent score of students admitted
-   `ACTCMMID`: Midpoint of the ACT cumulative score

### Data Preparation

1.  To get the data, we scraped from Niche.com and downloaded data from the US Department of Education, and imported. The steps were done in an R script titled `niche-scrape.R`
2.  Some of the college names were slightly different between datasets, so we had to individually change names in the Department of Education dataset to match those in the Niche one before joining the two. The Observations for `University of South Florida - Sarasota-Manatee` (ranked 141) and `University of South Florida - St. Petersburg` (ranked 181) have been dropped from the `colleges` data set because they do not exist in the `us_dep_of_ed` dataset. This is because these two universities were combined with the main University of South Florida campus. Therefore the joined `colleges` data set only has 498 observations.

4.  All of the numerical variables are on different scales---for example, SAT scores can range from 400 to 1600, while admission rate can only range from 0 to 1---and so we standardized them for easier analysis and comparison. We created a scaled version of the dataset where the mean value of each numeric variable is 0, and the standard deviation 1. The first row is presented below.

```{r}

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Means of Different Variables by Rank Group

```{r}
#| label: exploration-by-rank-group

colleges_levels <- data |> 
  mutate(
    level = case_when(
      rank <= 100 ~ "1 to 100",
      rank > 100 & rank <= 200 ~ "101 to 200",
      rank > 200 & rank <= 300 ~ "201 to 300",
      rank > 300 & rank <= 400 ~ "301 to 400",
      rank > 400 & rank <= 500 ~ "401 to 500",
    ),
    .after = rank
  )

colleges_levels |> 
  group_by(level) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_ADM_Rate = mean(ADM_RATE, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_SAT_AVG = mean(SAT_AVG, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_ACTCMMID = mean(ACTCMMID, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_UGDS_WHITE = mean(UGDS_WHITE, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_UGDS_ASIAN = mean(UGDS_ASIAN, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_COSTT4_A = mean(COSTT4_A, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  rename(
    "Interval" = level,
    "Mean Admission Rate" = mean_ADM_Rate,
    "Mean SAT Average" = mean_SAT_AVG,
    "Mean ACT Median" =  mean_ACTCMMID,
    "Mean % White Students" = mean_UGDS_WHITE,
    "Mean % Asian Students" = mean_UGDS_ASIAN,
    "Mean Cost of Attendance" = mean_COSTT4_A
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

After grouping the schools into five groups of 100 by their rank, we see that different metrics vary considerably across the group. As the rank level gets higher, the mean admission rate increases, the mean SAT Average decreases, the mean ACT Median decreases, and the cost of attendance decreases. As far as demographic statistics, 1-100 ranked schools have considerably fewer White students and considerably more Asian students than schools ranked above 100. As the rank gets higher, the mean cost of attendance also tends to increases.

### Means of Rank by Categorical Variables

Below, we group the schools by the different categorical variables in our analysis and then take the mean rank for each of those groups.

```{r}
#| label: exploration-control

group_by_control <- data |> 
  group_by(CONTROL) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_rank = mean(rank)
  ) |> 
  arrange(mean_rank) |> 
  rename(
    "Control" = CONTROL, 
    "Mean Rank" = mean_rank
  ) 

group_by_control


```

We observe that private non-profit colleges have a higher mean rank than public colleges or private for-profit colleges.

```{r}
#| label: exploration-region

data |> 
  group_by(REGION) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_rank = mean(rank)
  ) |> 
  arrange(mean_rank) |> 
  rename(
    "Region" = REGION, 
    "Mean Rank" = mean_rank
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

As far as region, schools from New England have the highest mean rank, while schools from the Plains have the lowest mean rank.

```{r}
#| label: exploration-CCBASIC

data |> 
  group_by(CCBASIC) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_rank = mean(rank)
  ) |> 
  arrange(mean_rank) |>
  rename(
    "Carnegie Classification (Basic)" = CCBASIC, 
    "Mean Rank" = mean_rank
  ) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Looking at the Carnegie Classification, Special Focus Four-Year: Business & Management Schools have the highest mean rank, followed by Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity. Tribal Colleges have the lowest mean rank.

## Research Question and Hypothesis

**Question:** Which characteristics of a university are most associated with rankings on the Niche College Ranking list? Of these characteristics, what is the relationship between high and low rank?

**Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that SAT/ACT scores, acceptance rate, and family income will have the strongest association with rank because since Niche's audience is in large part students applying to college, we believe that they prioritize variables important in the college admissions process. Of these variables, we predict that SAT/ACT score will have strong negative relationship, acceptance rate will have a strong positive relationship, and family income will have a strong negative relationship with rank.

In our project, we will join two data sets: The Niche College Rankings list and the US Department of Education College Scorecard

# Methodology

We have split the first part of our analysis into two approaches. The first approach consists of looking at he linear relationship between the numerical explanatory variables and college rank using R-squared variables. The second approach consists of building a stepwise regression model between many explanatory variables and college rank. As the variables that appear in the final model will be most important for determining rank, we will use the model results to corroborate our results from the first approach. As we cannot find an R-squared value or other numerical metric to measure a relationship involving a categorical variable, we decided to simply use the stepwise regression model to determine if there is a strong association between those variables and rank.

In the second part of our analysis, we will combine the results of the two approaches and characterize the relationship between rank and the variables with the strongest association with it.

## Approach #1: Individual Numerical Variable Analysis

1.  Create a linear regression model between each individual explanatory variable and college rank.

2.  Calculate the R-squared value for each respective model, rank the values from highest to lowest, and select the variables with the top 6 R-squared values.

3.  Create 6 scatter plots (with lines of best fit) to visualize the relationships between the 6 variables (determined in section 2) and college rank.

4.  Recreate the individual models with the scaled explanatory variables, and calculate the respective slopes between each of the scaled explanatory variables and college rank.

5.  Calculate the respective slopes between each of the un-scaled explanatory variables and college rank.

## Approach #2: Stepwise Regression Modeling

Another method we used to answer our research question of which characteristics are most associated with university rankings is through stepwise regression model. A stepwise regression model can manage large amounts of potential predictor variables and fine-tune the model to choose the best predictor variables from the available options. In our case, we have more than 25 variables to be examined and thus it is crucial to have a automated workflow for model selections.

In our research, we will use both forward and backward selections in the stepwise regression model by utilizing MASS package. We will evaluate the performance of each iteration of the model based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). AIC is used to compare different possible models and determine which one is the best fit for the data in statistic practice.

There are two main steps in this approach.

1.  Create a correlation matrix to check correlation coefficients between variables so as to not use similar variables in our model. If two variables had an absolute value of r greater than 0.8, meaning they were too similar in how they factored into rankings, we only picked one of them to put into the model.
2.  Compute the stepwise regression model using MASS package and mainly stepAIC() functions for model selections based on AIC. For the initial setting of the linear regression model, we will import all the valid variables into the model to predict the rank variable.

In the end, this will give us the best final model with much fewer variables. Those variables are the most influential factors to the rank of the college.

-   Why did we choose this

-   Why did we choose the criterions

-   Methods 

## Final Variable Categorical and Numerical Variable Analysis

We will examine the final variables selected by both approaches and analyze their relationships with college rank by:

1.  Interpreting the R-squared values to determine strength of linear association

2.  interpreting the graphs to visualize this relationship.

3.  Using the scaled slopes to determine which explanatory variable has the greatest influence on college on a school having a higher rank.

4.  Using the un-scaled slopes to interpret the relationships.h

# Results

## Approach #1: Individual Numerical Variable Analysis

**Table of R-squared Values**

The table below gives the R-squared values from the linear regression models between each individual explanatory variable in our data set and colleges rank, arranged in descending order.

```{r}
#| label: find-r2

numerical_variables  <- c(
  "ADM_RATE",
  "UGDS",
  "UGDS_WHITE",
  "UGDS_BLACK",
  "UGDS_HISP",
  "UGDS_ASIAN",
  "UGDS_AIAN",
  "UGDS_NHPI",
  "UGDS_2MOR",
  "UGDS_NRA",
  "UGDS_UNKN",
  "NPT4_PUB",
  "NPT4_PRIV",
  "COSTT4_A",
  "COSTT4_P",
  "AVGFACSAL",
  "PCTPELL",
  "C150_4",
  "AGE_ENTRY",
  "FEMALE",
  "MARRIED",
  "FIRST_GEN",
  "FAMINC",
  "MD_FAMINC",
  "ENDOWBEGIN",
  "SAT_AVG",
  "ACTCMMID"
)

r2s <- numeric()

for(var in numerical_variables) {
  temp_df <- data |>
  dplyr::select(c(rank, var))
  
  model <- linear_reg() |>
    set_engine("lm") |>
    fit(rank ~ ., data = temp_df)
  
  r2 <- glance(model)$r.squared
  
  r2s <- c(r2s, r2)
}

r_squared_values <- tibble(
  variable = numerical_variables, 
  r_squared = r2s
  ) |> 
  filter(variable != "COSTT4_P")

r_squared_values |>
  arrange(desc(r_squared)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

`COSTT4_P` (Average cost of attendance for program-year institutions) has been removed because there are only two observations.

Average SAT (`SAT_AVG`), median ACT (`ACTCMMID`), graduation rate (`C150_4`), average faculty salary (`AVGFACSAL`), and admission rate (`ADM_RATE`), are the five variables with the strongest correlation to rank, based on their R-Squared values. We chose five as a cutoff because there is a substantial between these five and the next variable (`PCTPELL)` .

## Approach 2: Stepwise Regression Model

### Remove Highly Correlated Variables

```{r}
#| label: correlation-matrix

    data_for_corr <- scaled_data |>
      dplyr::select(is.numeric)

    correlations = data_for_corr |>
      dplyr::select(-c("NPT4_PUB", "NPT4_PRIV", "COSTT4_P")) |>
        na.omit() |>
        cor() 

    correlations |>
        corrplot(method="color")
```

The correlation matrix above provides a visual representation of the correlation between all variable pairs. Below, is the filtered correlation matrix that only displays entries with values greater than or equal to 0.8.

```{r}
#| label: display-correlation-pair-to-be-removed

correlations[correlations < 0.8 | correlations == 1] <- ""
```

| Variable Pairs with r \> 0.8 | Correlation Coefficients |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| C150_4, SAT_AVG              | 0.8389                   |
| C150_4, ACTCMMID             | 0.8494                   |
| AGE_ENTRY, MARRIED           | 0.9059                   |
| FAMINC, MD_FAMINC            | 0.9538                   |
| SAT_AVG, ACTCMMID            | 0.9756                   |

According to the filtered table, these variable pairs are (`MD_FAMINC`, `FAMINC`), (`C150_4`, `SAT_AVG`), (`C150_4`, `ACTCMMID`) and (`ACTCMMID`, `SAT_AVG`). Therefore, we will drop the variables `C150_4`, `MD_FAMINC`, `ACTCMMID` and preserve `SAT_AVG` and `FAMINC` to represent all other variables.

### Compute Stepwise Regression

As mentioned in methodology, we will use `MASS` package and `StepAIC()` function to perform the stepwise regression process for model selections.

```{r}
#| label: stepwise-regression-model

stepwise_data <- scaled_data |>
  dplyr::select(c("college", "rank", "REGION", "CONTROL", "CCBASIC", "ACCREDAGENCY", "ADM_RATE", "UGDS", "UGDS_WHITE", "UGDS_BLACK", "UGDS_HISP", "UGDS_ASIAN", "UGDS_AIAN", "UGDS_NHPI", "UGDS_2MOR", "UGDS_NRA", "UGDS_UNKN", "COSTT4_A", "AVGFACSAL", "PCTPELL", "AGE_ENTRY", "FAMINC", "ENDOWBEGIN", "SAT_AVG", "FEMALE", "FIRST_GEN"))
stepwise_data |>
  names() |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = "Selected Variables")
# Factorize variable
stepwise_data <- stepwise_data |>
  mutate(
    REGION = as.factor(REGION),
    CONTROL = as.factor(CONTROL),
    CCBASIC = as.factor(CCBASIC),
    ACCREDAGENCY = as.factor(ACCREDAGENCY)
    )
library(MASS)
stepwise_data = na.omit(stepwise_data)
# Fit the full model
full_model <- lm(rank ~. -college, data = stepwise_data)
# Stepwise regression model
stepwise_model <- stepAIC(full_model, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)

stepwise_model$anova
```

In the stepwise regression shown above, each step represents a new iteration of the model after a certain variable is taken out. For example, the first step represents the first iteration with all the variables. Then, the variable `FAMINC` was removed, leading to a decrease in AIC. Then, one-by-one, it removes `PCTPELL`, `ENDOWBEGIN`, each level of undergraduate ethnicities, and female student population to continue making the best model for our data. Finally, the re-addition of `UGDS_HISP` led to the final iteration our of model with just 16 variables. We can tell this is the best model because its AIC value is the lowest.

### Model Results

```{r}
#| label: visualize-stepwise-model

aic_value = stepwise_model$anova$AIC

variables = c("All", "-FAMINC", "-PCTPELL", "-ENDOWBEGIN", "-UGDS_NHPI", "-UGDS_AIAN", "-UGDS_NRA", "-UGDSHISP", "-UGDS_BLACK", "-UGDS_WHITE", "-FEMALE", "+UGDS_HISP")

aic_df = data.frame(aic_value, variables)

aic_df<- aic_df |>
  mutate(variables = as.factor(variables))

aic_df <- aic_df |>
  mutate(
    variables = fct_relevel(variables, levels = c("All", "-FAMINC", "-PCTPELL", "-ENDOWBEGIN", "-UGDS_NHPI", "-UGDS_AIAN", "-UGDS_NRA", "-UGDSHISP", "-UGDS_BLACK", "-UGDS_WHITE", "-FEMALE", "+UGDS_HISP"))
  )

aic_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = variables, y = aic_value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(group = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(3415, 3431, by = 2)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Variable selection process",
    x = "Selection step",
    y = "AIC"
  )
  
```

The plot above visually displays the decreasing AIC value as variables get taken out and potentially re-added.

```{r}
#| label: r-squared-final-model

final_model_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(rank ~ REGION + CONTROL + CCBASIC + ACCREDAGENCY + ADM_RATE + 
    UGDS + UGDS_ASIAN + UGDS_2MOR + UGDS_UNKN + COSTT4_A + AVGFACSAL + 
    AGE_ENTRY + SAT_AVG + FIRST_GEN + UGDS_HISP, data = scaled_data)

glance(final_model_fit) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

We can further tell that this is our best model because it has an r-squared coefficient of 0.774. The variables here can then be considered to be the variables that affect a college's ranking the most. Region (`REGION`) and type of school (`CONTROL`, `CCBASIC`) influence its ranking. There are certain qualities of its undergraduate population that are more statistically significant than others and were thus included in this model: overall undergraduate population, number of Asians, Hispanics, mixed students, and first-generation students, and average age when the undergraduated enrolled. Average SAT score was also significant enough to be include into the model, and `ACCREDAGENCY` and cost of attendance were also the final two variables considered significant enough for our best model.

## Final Variable Analysis

### Categorical Variable Analysis

All four categorical variables appeared in the final model, and therefore we can assume that they have a significant association with rank.

  )
```

The Geographic Region graph shows that New England has the highest proportion of top-100 schools, while the Plains has the lowest. Apart from the `New England` and `NA` bars, the differences in proportions of rank groups do not vary dramatically between bars.

There does not appear to be a obvious pattern in the accreditation agency graph, which could be because some of the agencies corresponded to very few schools in the top 500. Additionally, as accreditation agency is often based on location, it reflects results similar to the region graph. However...

There are only 4 `Private, For-profit` schools in the top 500, and all of them are ranked between 301 and 400. The proportions of ranks between `Private, Non-profit` and `Public` are similar, although the first appears to have a larger proportion of `1-100` schools, and the latter a higher proportion of `401-500` schools.

There appear to be the greatest differences between bars of proportions of rank groups in the Carnegie Classification group, suggesting that this has the strongest association with rank. It appears that the lower the rank, the higher proportion of schools in `Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity` and `Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus`. However, the opposite appeared to be true for all other classifications with 3 or more rank categories. Like accreditation agencies, some classifications corresponded to very few schools in the top 500.

Qualitatively, it appears that region and Carnegie Classification have the clearest relationship with rank; however, the final model indicates that they all have an association with rank.

### Numerical Variable Analysis

All of the variables with the top 5 R-squared values appeared in the final stepwise regression model except for ACTCMMID (median ACT score) and C150_4 (graduation rate). These were not used in the model because both of them had a high correlation with SAT_AVG (average SAT). Because SAT_AVG ended up in the final model, we can reasonably assume that they also have a strong association with rank based on the model's selection process. Therefore, we conclude that SAT_AVG, ACTCMMID, C150_4, and ADM_RATE have the strongest association with rank and we will characterize the relationship below.

**How do these 5 metrics influence Niche college rank?**

**Analysis**

Based on our analysis, these five variables are the numerical explanatory variables most associated with college ranking (as determined in our individual variable analysis and confirmed in our step-wise regression model. We hypothesized that SAT/ACT scores, acceptance rate, and family income would have the strongest association with rank, and our results mostly confirm this hypothesis. SAT/ACT/Acceptance Rate were among the most correlated variables, but family income was not in the top five.

The clearest way to interpret these R-Squared values is the following: 63% of the variation in college rank can be explained by average SAT score. This same interpretation can be used for all of the variables.

These relationships indicate certain priorities in college rankings. As SAT and ACT scores are the most correlated variables and acceptance rate is in the top five, it is clear that the rankings highly prioritize selectivity in college admissions. This is logical since the audience of the rankings is mostly prospective students who are applying to college. There are obvious concerns with this approach: does it cause colleges to prioritize improving admissions selectivity over their quality of education and student outcomes? The inclusion of graduation rate and faculty salary do tell slightly different stories. Graduation rate indicates a focus on the ability of a university to meet the needs of its students and give them the resources and support. Faculty salary, in a way, may indicate the quality of the faculty both in teaching and research.

Looking further at the relationships, there is a negative relationship between SAT/ACT/Graduation Rate/Faculty Salary and rank. This indicates that as the variables increase, the rank of the school decreases. There is a positive relationship between admission rate and rank, indicating that as this variable increases, the rank of a school increases.

Looking at the un-scaled slope allows us to interpret how much changes in the explanatory variable change rank. For example for ACT, we can say that on average, we can expect a 1-point increase in ACT score to drop the rank of a school by 30 places. For admission rate, since it is scaled from 0-1, we need to divide the slope by 100 to get an interpretable number. It indicates that a 1-point drop in admission rate will drop the rank of the school by 3.87 places.

Looking at the scaled slope allows us to tell which variables have the greatest "influence" on rank. In other words, which change in a numerical variable away from the mean has the greatest impact on decreasing a school's rank? An extremely interesting trend is that among the five most associated variables, schools that have a stronger R-squared also have a higher absolute value of scaled-slope, indicating that variables that have the strongest association to rank also have the greatest influence on decreasing rank. This is logical because Niche would likely tie their rankings to variables where there is the greatest differentiation between schools with higher and lower ranks. This is also concerning because if schools know which variables are most associated to rank and which ones have the greatest impact on decreasing it, it is fairly easy for them to know which variables to change if they wanted to manipulate the rankings.

# Discussion

There are some variables that appear in the final model that have a lower individual R-squared value than some that were taken out of the model. This is because the model selected variables based on AIC rather than R-squared values. Additionally, it examines the collective predictive power of the variables rather than simply the predictive ability of variables individually. NOT DONE
