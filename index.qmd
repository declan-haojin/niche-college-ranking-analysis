This project aims to explore how associated and influential different metrics are in determining a college's ranking on the Niche College Ranking List. Our research methodology is split into two parts: the first approach consists of looking at he linear relationship between the numerical explanatory variables and college rank using R-squared variables. The second approach consists of building a stepwise regression model between many explanatory variables and college rank. The results suggest that `SAT_AVG`, `ACTCMMID`, `C150_4`, `AVGFACSAL`, and `ADM_RATE` are the numerical explanatory variables most associated with college ranking. The results also provide greater insight into what factors are important when considering college rankings, and will help students make more informed decisions when applying to college.
