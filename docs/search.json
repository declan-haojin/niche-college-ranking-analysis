    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nThe dataset lemur_data.csv comes from Kaggle.com and was released by Jesse Mostipak.\nThe dataset was orginally collected from the 2019 data release from the Duke Lemur Center Database and further compiled by Zehr, SM, Roach RG, Haring D, Taylor J, Cameron FH, Yoder AD in their research paper.\nAnimal data have been collected and entered by Duke Lemur Center staff according to standard operating procedures and USDA, AZA, and IACUC guidelines throughout the history of the center (United States Department of Agriculture, Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee respectively). Births, deaths, weights, enclosure moves, behaviors, and other significant events are recorded daily by animal care, veterinary, and research staff and subsequently entered into the permanent records by the DLC Registrar.\nThis dataset contains information on over 3,500 observations. Each observation represent a lemur, including lemur-information such as ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass (in total 54 columns)."

    "text": "Research question\n\nWhat are the top 3 factors that influence the lifespan of lemurs?\nLemurs are the most endangered group of mammals. In fact, 98% of lemur species are endangered, and 31% of species are critically endangered nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct researches on the lifespan of lemurs to save the endangered species. Moreover, Duke Lemur Center has been the world leader in the study, care, and protection of lemurs since it was founded in 1966. As Duke students, we are able to utilize the resources at DLC to research on lemurs and potentially contribute to their studies.\nThrough our preliminary investigation, we found that the death age of lemurs varies a lot ranging from 0 to 35. Thus, we are interested in researching on what are the determining factors of lemurs’ lifespan. Our hypotheses is that taxon, sex, weight are the top 3 factors that would affect the lifespan of lemurs.\nWe plan to research on all the variables within the dataset that could potentially affect lemur’s lifespan. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research questions since categorical variables such as taxon and quantitative variables such as weight can all play a role in their lifespan."

    "text": "Research question\n\nDoes the frequency of earthquakes at a certain location have any relationship to their magnitude or significance?\nThis question is important because by determining if there are relationships between the variables, we can then consider the living conditions of people that live in those locations. There might be certain locations in which earthquakes are at their strongest and people should not be living there, or maybe locations in which we have to consider what kinds of infrastructure buildings should have to prevent them from collapsing as a result of multiple strong earthquakes.\nA rough look at the first 50 observations showed that a lot of earthquakes happened in Alaska and California. This made us wonder why this was the case and to see if those patterns are consistent throughout the rest of the data. Furthermore, because earthquakes happen more often in those states, we wonder if they are stronger than earthquakes that only occur once at a certain location and if they overall have a higher significance. Our hypothesis is that frequency and magnitude will have a positive correlation, and that the average significance of the more frequent locations will be higher than the average significance of less frequent locations.\nOur research question focuses on four variables: location, frequency, magnitude, and significance. For location, we can consider the nominal categorical variable location.name which gives us the state/country in which the earthquake occurred. We can also consider location.longitude and location.latitude which gives us the exact coordinates of an earthquake’s location, which would be continuous numerical variables. impact.magnitude displays the magnitude of an earthquake which is a continuous numerical variable. We will also consider impact.significance, which is a discrete numerical variable and gives the significance of each earthquake based on a range of factors including estimated impact, magnitude, and felt reports. Lastly, we will calculate frequency, a discrete numerical variable, based on the location data."

The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: the name of the school and the rank of the school.\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States. There were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to select the variables we needed to import.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States. There are 63 variables in the data set, which give information about each different school.\nThere are no obvious ethical or privacy concerns with this data.

    "text": "Introduction and data\nEvery year, millions of students apply to colleges across the United State, and many of them use college rankings lists from sources such as US News and World Report, Forbes.com, and Niche.com to to help them decide where to apply and where to go. In recent years, these lists have been heavily criticized for focusing on “exclusivity and resources, rather than accessibility and economic mobility” (1).The system can also be easily gamed by a university if that university focuses on improving the metrics used in the list, as seen in Northeastern University meteoric rise from #163 to #49 on the US News and World Report list, in only 17 year; the president even explicitly stated that it a top priority of the university to raise its ranking (2).\n(1) https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/3641004-the-scandal-facing-college-ranking-lists-explained/\n(2) https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/\nThese lists are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to large impact that a college has on a student’s life, it is important to know where these ranking come from and what they actually measure. In this project, we will explore how influential different metrics are in determining a college’s ranking.\nIn general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school’s ranking on the Niche College Ranking List. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and acceptance rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren’t typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.\nQuestion: What variables (and what types of variables) have the greatest influence on school’s place in the Niche College Ranking List?\nHypothesis: We hypothesize that: ACT/SAT test score, acceptance rate, and median earnings 10 years after graduation will have the biggest impact on college rank.\nIn our project, we will join two data sets: The Niche College Rankings list and the US Department of Education College Scorecard\nData Set #1: Niche\n\nThe first data set comes from Niche’s “2023 Best Colleges in America” list\n(https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/)\nNiche aggregates data from a variety of sources, including the US Department of Education and reviews from students and alumni, to build their list of college rankings. The rankings list is updated monthly to reflect new data that Niche receives; although, data from the US Department o Education is only received on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: the name of the school (college) and (rank) and the rank of the school.\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to narrow this to 63 variables.There are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nHere is a summary of the data we will be using in or analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nC/Q\nDescription\nLevels of Cat.

Because of the positive slope, the more white students a college has, the number of the ranking is bigger which means a “lower” ranking.\nProvide only the main results from your analysis. The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis (calculate every possible statistic and perform every possible procedure for all variables). Rather, you should demonstrate that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them using data, that you are skilled in interpreting and presenting results, and that you can accomplish these tasks using R. More is not better."
