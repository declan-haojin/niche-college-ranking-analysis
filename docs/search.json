    "text": "Introduction\n\nResearch Background\nEvery year, millions of students apply to colleges across the United States, and many of them use college rankings lists from sources such as US News and World Report, Forbes.com, and Niche.com to to help them decide where to apply and where to go. In recent years, these lists have been heavily criticized for focusing on “exclusivity and resources, rather than accessibility and economic mobility”(1).The system can also be easily manipulated by a university if that university prioritize certain metrics to raise their rankings, as seen in Northeastern University meteoric rise from #163 to #49 on the US News and World Report list in only 17 years. The president of Northeastern University even explicitly stated that it was a top priority of the university to raise its ranking (2).\n\nhttps://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/3641004-the-scandal-facing-college-ranking-lists-explained/\n\n(2) https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/\nThese lists are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to the large impact that a college has on a student’s life, it is important to know where these rankings come from and what they actually measure. In this project, we will explore how influential different metrics are in determining a college’s ranking.\nIn general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school’s ranking on the Niche College Ranking List and determine which are most important to a high ranking. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and admission rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren’t typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.\nFor the sake of clarity, when we say a “low rank,” we are referring to schools with a lower numerical rank, such as #1 and #2. When we say a “high rank,” we a referring to schools with a high numerical rank, such as #499 and #500.\n\n\nResearch Question and Hypothesis\nQuestion: Which characteristics of a university are most associated with rankings on the Niche College Ranking list? Of these characteristics, what is the relationship between high and low rank?\nHypothesis: We hypothesize that SAT/ACT scores, acceptance rate, and family income will have the strongest association with rank because since Niche’s audience is in large part students applying to college, we believe that they prioritize variables important in the college admissions process. Of these variables, we predict that SAT/ACT score will have strong negative relationship, acceptance rate will have a strong positive relationship, and family income will have a strong negative relationship with rank.\nIn our project, we will join two data sets: The Niche College Rankings list and the US Department of Education College Scorecard"

The rankings list is updated monthly to reflect new data that Niche receives. However, Niche only receives data from the US Department of Education on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: college and rank.\n\n\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to narrow this to 31 variables. We chose any variables that we thought would have an impact on college rank, and excluded redundant ones like specific breaksdowns of test scores. There are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\nData summary\nHere is a summary of the variables we will be using in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nCategorical (C)\nQuantitative (Q)\nDescription\nLevels of Cat.

    "text": "Methodology\n\nData Preparation\n\nTo get the data, we scraped from Niche.com and downloaded data from the US Department of Education, and imported. The steps were done in an R script titled niche-scrape.R\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the college names were slightly different between datasets, so we had to individually change names in the Department of Education dataset to match those in the Niche one before joining the two. The Observations for University of South Florida - Sarasota-Manatee and University of South Florida - St. Petersburg have been dropped from the colleges data set due to their non-existence in the us_dep_of_ed data set. They were not present in the data set because these two universities were combined with the main University of South Florida campus. This is why the colleges data set only has 498 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe joined the US Department of Education dataset to the Niche dataset by the college names.

of 100 by their rank, we see that different metrics vary considerably across the group. As the rank level gets higher, the mean admission rate increases, the mean SAT Average decreases, the mean ACT Median decreases, and the cost of attendance decreases. As far as demographic statistics, 1-100 ranked schools have considerably fewer White students and considerably more Asian students than schools ranked above 100.\n\n\nMeans of Rank by Categorical Variables\nBelow, we group the schools by the different categorical variables in our analysis and then take the mean rank for each of those groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nPrivate, Non-profit\n236.568\n\n\nPublic\n269.670\n\n\nPivate, For-profit\n360.750\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that private non-profit colleges have a higher mean rank than public colleges or private for-profit colleges.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nNA\n81.5000\n\n\nNew England\n162.9070\n\n\nFar West\n222.6102\n\n\nMid East\n229.7416\n\n\nGreat Lakes\n260.5362\n\n\nSoutheast\n273.7627\n\n\nRocky Mountains\n273.8000\n\n\nSouthwest\n285.5122\n\n\nPlains\n293.2632\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as region, schools from New England have the highest mean rank, while schools from the Plains have the lowest mean rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarnegie Classification (Basic)\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Business & Management Schools\n55.0000\n\n\nDoctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity\n123.8629\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Engineering Schools\n148.5000\n\n\nBaccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus\n199.4045\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Faith-Related Institutions\n213.0000\n\n\nBaccalaureate/Associate’s Colleges: Mixed Baccalaureate/Associate’s\n248.0000\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Health Professions Schools\n268.0000\n\n\nDoctoral Universities: High Research Activity\n279.5663\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Small Programs\n307.0000\n\n\nBaccalaureate Colleges: Diverse Fields\n313.3500\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Arts, Music & Design Schools\n329.5000\n\n\nDoctoral/Professional Universities\n331.5962\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Special Focus Institutions\n351.0000\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs\n363.2727\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Medium Programs\n365.2069\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Technology-Related Schools\n385.0000\n\n\nNA\n430.6667\n\n\nTribal Colleges\n453.0000\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the Carnegie Classification, Special Focus Four-Year: Business & Management Schools have the highest mean rank, followed by Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity.

There appears to be somewhat of a positive association between % of undergrads who are white/% of first generation students and college ranks. This means that as these metrics decrease, the rank of a school is expected to decrease\nThere appears to be a strong negative association between % of undergrads who are Asian/% of undergrads who are non-resident aliens/average faculty salary/graduation rate and college rank. There appears to be somewhat of a negative relationship between average net price for private universities/cost of attendance/average family income/median family income and college rank. This means that as these metrics increase, the rank of a school is expected to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all type of standardized test scores, there appear to be a strong negative relationship between score and rank, indicating that as the test scores increases, the rank of a school is expected to to increase.\n\n\n\nCheck Correlation Coefficients\nWe checked the correlation coefficients between the variables so we don’t use variables that are too similar in our model.

    "text": "Methodology\n\nData Preparation\n\nTo get the data, we scraped from Niche.com and downloaded data from the US Department of Education, and imported. The steps were done in an R script titled niche-scrape.R\n\n\n\nSome of the college names were slightly different between datasets, so we had to individually change names in the Department of Education dataset to match those in the Niche one before joining the two. The Observations for University of South Florida - Sarasota-Manatee (ranked 141) and University of South Florida - St. Petersburg (ranked 181) have been dropped from the colleges data set due to their non-existence in the us_dep_of_ed data set. They were not present in the data set because these two universities were combined with the main University of South Florida campus. This is why the colleges data set only has 498 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe joined the US Department of Education dataset to the Niche dataset by the college names.

As the rank level gets higher, the mean admission rate increases, the mean SAT Average decreases, the mean ACT Median decreases, and the cost of attendance decreases. As far as demographic statistics, 1-100 ranked schools have considerably fewer White students and considerably more Asian students than schools ranked above 100.\n\n\nMeans of Rank by Categorical Variables\nBelow, we group the schools by the different categorical variables in our analysis and then take the mean rank for each of those groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nPrivate, Non-profit\n236.568\n\n\nPublic\n269.670\n\n\nPrivate, For-profit\n360.750\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that private non-profit colleges have a higher mean rank than public colleges or private for-profit colleges.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nNA\n81.5000\n\n\nNew England\n162.9070\n\n\nFar West\n222.6102\n\n\nMid East\n229.7416\n\n\nGreat Lakes\n260.5362\n\n\nSoutheast\n273.7627\n\n\nRocky Mountains\n273.8000\n\n\nSouthwest\n285.5122\n\n\nPlains\n293.2632\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as region, schools from New England have the highest mean rank, while schools from the Plains have the lowest mean rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarnegie Classification (Basic)\nMean Rank\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Business & Management Schools\n55.0000\n\n\nDoctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity\n123.8629\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Engineering Schools\n148.5000\n\n\nBaccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus\n199.4045\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Faith-Related Institutions\n213.0000\n\n\nBaccalaureate/Associate’s Colleges: Mixed Baccalaureate/Associate’s\n248.0000\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Health Professions Schools\n268.0000\n\n\nDoctoral Universities: High Research Activity\n279.5663\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Small Programs\n307.0000\n\n\nBaccalaureate Colleges: Diverse Fields\n313.3500\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Arts, Music & Design Schools\n329.5000\n\n\nDoctoral/Professional Universities\n331.5962\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Special Focus Institutions\n351.0000\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Larger Programs\n363.2727\n\n\nMaster’s Colleges & Universities: Medium Programs\n365.2069\n\n\nSpecial Focus Four-Year: Other Technology-Related Schools\n385.0000\n\n\nNA\n430.6667\n\n\nTribal Colleges\n453.0000\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the Carnegie Classification, Special Focus Four-Year: Business & Management Schools have the highest mean rank, followed by Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity.

There appears to be somewhat of a positive association between % of undergrads who are white/% of first generation students and college ranks. This means that as these metrics decrease, the rank of a school is expected to decrease\nThere appears to be a strong negative association between % of undergrads who are Asian/% of undergrads who are non-resident aliens/average faculty salary/graduation rate and college rank. There appears to be somewhat of a negative relationship between average net price for private universities/cost of attendance/average family income/median family income and college rank. This means that as these metrics increase, the rank of a school is expected to increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all type of standardized test scores, there appear to be a strong negative relationship between score and rank, indicating that as the test scores increases, the rank of a school is expected to to increase.\n\n\n\nCheck Correlation Coefficients\nWe checked the correlation coefficients between the variables so we don’t use variables that are too similar in our model. For the ones that have a absolute value of r greater than 0.8, we picked only one to put in the model. We removed the columns that has more than 100 NA and used the rest for calculating correlations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the correlation matrix, we need to remove variable pairs that have a high correlation (the absolute value > 0.8). In order to do so, we filter the following correlation table to only display entries with value greater or equal to 0.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Pairs with r > 0.8\nCorrelation Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nC150_4, SAT_AVG\n0.8389\n\n\nC150_4, ACTCMMID\n0.8494\n\n\nAGE_ENTRY, MARRIED\n0.9059\n\n\nFAMINC, MD_FAMINC\n0.9538\n\n\nSAT_AVG, ACTCMMID\n0.9756\n\n\n\nAccording to the filtered table, these variable pairs are (MD_FAMINC, FAMINC), (C150_4, SAT_AVG), (C150_4, ACTCMMID) and (ACTCMMID, SAT_AVG). Therefore, we will drop the variables C150_4, MD_FAMINC, ACTCMMID and preserve SAT_AVG and FAMINC to represent all other variables.\n\n\nBuild model\nBecause we want to predict college rank, a number from various variables, we decided that a linear regression model would be the best statistical method to answer our question. We began our modeling by removing the variables with a correlation coefficient above 0.8.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Variables\n\n\n\n\ncollege\n\n\nrank\n\n\nREGION\n\n\nCONTROL\n\n\nCCBASIC\n\n\nACCREDAGENCY\n\n\nADM_RATE\n\n\nUGDS\n\n\nUGDS_WHITE\n\n\nUGDS_BLACK\n\n\nUGDS_HISP\n\n\nUGDS_ASIAN\n\n\nUGDS_AIAN\n\n\nUGDS_NHPI\n\n\nUGDS_2MOR\n\n\nUGDS_NRA\n\n\nUGDS_UNKN\n\n\nCOSTT4_A\n\n\nAVGFACSAL\n\n\nPCTPELL\n\n\nAGE_ENTRY\n\n\nFAMINC\n\n\nENDOWBEGIN\n\n\nSAT_AVG\n\n\nFEMALE\n\n\nMARRIED\n\n\nFIRST_GEN\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we need to split dataset into two parts: a training and a test set.

However, in an effort to determine which variables have the most significant impact on college ranking, we can look at those with the lowest p-values: ADM_RATE, UGDS, AVGFACSAL, and SAT_AVG. Then, we can further single out the most significant variable with R-squared values.\n\n\nR-Squared Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n\n\n\n\n0.4153932\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between admission rate and college ranking gives us an R-squared value of 0.415 which is not that good and shows that admission rate might not be as significant as we originally thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n\n\n\n\n0.0479294\n\n\n\n\n\nAs evident from the graph and the given R-squared value of 0.048, undergraduate enrollment has almost no impact on a college’s ranking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n\n\n\n\n0.4768954\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile still relatively low, the R-squared value of 0.477 for the relationship between average faculty salary and ranking is higher than that of admission rate vs rank. This signifies that average faculty salary is a slightly more significant variable in predicting college ranking than admission rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plot above, a college’s average SAT score has an almost semi-linear impact on it’s ranking. Typically, as average SAT score increases, a college’s ranking improves. Furthermore, we can see how well correlated these two variables are by creating a linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n\n\n\n\n0.6410464\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile an R-squared value of 0.641 is not the best, it is still the highest out of these variables which means that we can conclude that average SAT score has the greatest impact on a college ranking.\n\n\nFinal Conclusion"

In fact, 98% of lemur species are endangered, and 31% of species are critically endangered nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct researches on the lifespan of lemurs to save the endangered species. Moreover, Duke Lemur Center has been the world leader in the study, care, and protection of lemurs since it was founded in 1966. As Duke students, we are able to utilize the resources at DLC to research on lemurs and potentially contribute to their studies.\nThrough our preliminary investigation, we found that the death age of lemurs varies a lot ranging from 0 to 35. Thus, we are interested in researching on what are the determining factors of lemurs’ lifespan. Our hypotheses is that taxon, sex, weight are the top 3 factors that would affect the lifespan of lemurs.\nWe plan to research on all the variables within the dataset that could potentially affect lemur’s lifespan. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research questions since categorical variables such as taxon and quantitative variables such as weight can all play a role in their lifespan."

    "text": "Research question\n\nDoes the frequency of earthquakes at a certain location have any relationship to their magnitude or significance?\nThis question is important because by determining if there are relationships between the variables, we can then consider the living conditions of people that live in those locations. There might be certain locations in which earthquakes are at their strongest and people should not be living there, or maybe locations in which we have to consider what kinds of infrastructure buildings should have to prevent them from collapsing as a result of multiple strong earthquakes.\nA rough look at the first 50 observations showed that a lot of earthquakes happened in Alaska and California. This made us wonder why this was the case and to see if those patterns are consistent throughout the rest of the data. Furthermore, because earthquakes happen more often in those states, we wonder if they are stronger than earthquakes that only occur once at a certain location and if they overall have a higher significance. Our hypothesis is that frequency and magnitude will have a positive correlation, and that the average significance of the more frequent locations will be higher than the average significance of less frequent locations.\nOur research question focuses on four variables: location, frequency, magnitude, and significance. For location, we can consider the nominal categorical variable location.name which gives us the state/country in which the earthquake occurred. We can also consider location.longitude and location.latitude which gives us the exact coordinates of an earthquake’s location, which would be continuous numerical variables. impact.magnitude displays the magnitude of an earthquake which is a continuous numerical variable. We will also consider impact.significance, which is a discrete numerical variable and gives the significance of each earthquake based on a range of factors including estimated impact, magnitude, and felt reports. Lastly, we will calculate frequency, a discrete numerical variable, based on the location data."

    "text": "Introduction and data\nTo answer our question, we want to join two data sets. Both are listed below.\nData Set #1: Niche\n\nThe first data set comes from Niche’s “2023 Best Colleges in America” list\n(https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/)\nNiche aggregates data from a variety of sources, including the US Department of Education and reviews from students and alumni, to build their list of college rankings. The rankings list is updated monthly to reflect new data that Niche receives; although, data from the US Department o Education is only received on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: the name of the school and the rank of the school.\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States. There were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to select the variables we needed to import.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States. There are 63 variables in the data set, which give information about each different school.\nThere are no obvious ethical or privacy concerns with this data. The schools did not report data on individual students but rather summary data of all students.\n\nThe Department of Education data set was left joined to Niche dataset by school name to make a new data set with 500 observations and 64 variables."

    "text": "Research question\n\nHere are three potential research questions:\n\nHow do rankings compare across different types of schools (by region, by racial makeup, by school type)?\nWhich three variable have the greatest impact on a college’s ranking?\nDo “input variables” like ACT/SAT, GPA, and type of high school matter more to a college’s ranking than “output variable” like median income and graduation rate?\n\nThese questions are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to large impact that a college has on a student’s life, it is important to know where these ranking come from and what they actually measure.\nIn general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school’s ranking on the Niche College Ranking List. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and acceptance rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren’t typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.\nWe hypothesize that:\n\nschools that are from the northeast, are majority-white, and are private will have higher rankings on average.\nACT/SAT test score, acceptance rate, and median earnings 10 years after graduation will have the biggest impact on college rank.\ninput variables will matter more because they are more important to students applying to college, and the ranking list is geared towards them.\n\nHere are the types of variables involved in our research questions:\n\nCategorical (nominal):\n\ncity\nstate\nzip\naccreditor institution\ncontrol (public vs. private)\nCarnegie classification\n\nNumerical (continuous):\n\nlatitude, longitude\nadmission rate\nTotal share of enrollment by racial groups\naverage net price\naverage cost of attendance\naverage faculty salary\npercentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell grant\ncompletion rate\naverage age of entry\nshare of female students\nshare of married students\nshare of first generation students\nmedian & mean family income\nmedian & mean earning 10 years after entry\nValue of school’s endowment\n\nNumerical (discrete)\n\n25th/50th/75th/mean ACT/SAT scores for sub-tests and composite\nEnrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students"
