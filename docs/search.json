Births, deaths, weights, enclosure moves, behaviors, and other significant events are recorded daily by animal care, veterinary, and research staff and subsequently entered into the permanent records by the DLC Registrar.\nThis dataset contains information on over 3,500 observations. Each observation represent a lemur, including lemur-information such as ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass (in total 54 columns)."

    "text": "Research question\n\nWhat are the top 3 factors that influence the lifespan of lemurs?\nLemurs are the most endangered group of mammals. In fact, 98% of lemur species are endangered, and 31% of species are critically endangered nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct researches on the lifespan of lemurs to save the endangered species. Moreover, Duke Lemur Center has been the world leader in the study, care, and protection of lemurs since it was founded in 1966. As Duke students, we are able to utilize the resources at DLC to research on lemurs and potentially contribute to their studies.\nThrough our preliminary investigation, we found that the death age of lemurs varies a lot ranging from 0 to 35. Thus, we are interested in researching on what are the determining factors of lemurs’ lifespan. Our hypotheses is that taxon, sex, weight are the top 3 factors that would affect the lifespan of lemurs.\nWe plan to research on all the variables within the dataset that could potentially affect lemur’s lifespan. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research questions since categorical variables such as taxon and quantitative variables such as weight can all play a role in their lifespan."

    "text": "Research question\n\nDoes the frequency of earthquakes at a certain location have any relationship to their magnitude or significance?\nThis question is important because by determining if there are relationships between the variables, we can then consider the living conditions of people that live in those locations. There might be certain locations in which earthquakes are at their strongest and people should not be living there, or maybe locations in which we have to consider what kinds of infrastructure buildings should have to prevent them from collapsing as a result of multiple strong earthquakes.\nA rough look at the first 50 observations showed that a lot of earthquakes happened in Alaska and California. This made us wonder why this was the case and to see if those patterns are consistent throughout the rest of the data. Furthermore, because earthquakes happen more often in those states, we wonder if they are stronger than earthquakes that only occur once at a certain location and if they overall have a higher significance. Our hypothesis is that frequency and magnitude will have a positive correlation, and that the average significance of the more frequent locations will be higher than the average significance of less frequent locations.\nOur research question focuses on four variables: location, frequency, magnitude, and significance. For location, we can consider the nominal categorical variable location.name which gives us the state/country in which the earthquake occurred. We can also consider location.longitude and location.latitude which gives us the exact coordinates of an earthquake’s location, which would be continuous numerical variables. impact.magnitude displays the magnitude of an earthquake which is a continuous numerical variable. We will also consider impact.significance, which is a discrete numerical variable and gives the significance of each earthquake based on a range of factors including estimated impact, magnitude, and felt reports. Lastly, we will calculate frequency, a discrete numerical variable, based on the location data."

There were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to select the variables we needed to import.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States. There are 63 variables in the data set, which give information about each different school.\nThere are no obvious ethical or privacy concerns with this data.
