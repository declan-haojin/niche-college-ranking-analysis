Births, deaths, weights, enclosure moves, behaviors, and other significant events are recorded daily by animal care, veterinary, and research staff and subsequently entered into the permanent records by the DLC Registrar.\nThis dataset contains information on over 3,500 observations. Each observation represent a lemur, including lemur-information such as ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass (in total 54 columns)."

In fact, 98% of lemur species are endangered, and 31% of species are critically endangered nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct researches on the lifespan of lemurs to save the endangered species. Moreover, Duke Lemur Center has been the world leader in the study, care, and protection of lemurs since it was founded in 1966. As Duke students, we are able to utilize the resources at DLC to research on lemurs and potentially contribute to their studies.\nThrough our preliminary investigation, we found that the death age of lemurs varies a lot ranging from 0 to 35. Thus, we are interested in researching on what are the determining factors of lemurs’ lifespan. Our hypotheses is that taxon, sex, weight are the top 3 factors that would affect the lifespan of lemurs.\nWe plan to research on all the variables within the dataset that could potentially affect lemur’s lifespan. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research questions since categorical variables such as taxon and quantitative variables such as weight can all play a role in their lifespan. (include types of categorical and quantitative variables and examples)"

Does the frequency of an earthquake’s location have any correlation to its strength and magnitude? -- It seems like the two questions kind of say the same thing. Also strength doesn’t appear to be a variable. Could you use significance/depth/gap instead?\nAlso say why it is important (maybe for predicting the danger of earthquakes to save lives or something)\nA rough look at the first 50 observations showed that a lot of earthquakes happened in Alaska and California. This made us wonder why this was the case and to see if those patterns are consistent throughout the rest of the data. Furthermore, because earthquakes happen more often in those states, we wonder if they are stronger than earthquakes that only occur once at a certain location. Our hypothesis is that location and magnitude have a positive correlation. — you need to have 3 variables in the research question/hypothesis.\nOur research question focuses on two things: location and magnitude. For location, we can consider the nominal categorical variable “location.name” which gives us the state/country in which the earthquake occurred. We can also consider “location.longitude” and “location.latitude” which gives us the exact coordinates of an earthquake’s location, which would be continuous numerical variables. “Impact.magnitude” displays the magnitude of an earthquake which is a continuous numerical variable."
