    "text": "Research Background\nEvery year, millions of students apply to colleges across the United States, and many of them use college rankings lists from sources such as US News and World Report, Forbes.com, and Niche.com to to help them decide where to apply and where to go. In recent years, these lists have been heavily criticized for focusing on “exclusivity and resources, rather than accessibility and economic mobility” (1).The system can also be easily manipulated by a university if that university prioritize certain metrics to raise their rankings, as seen in Northeastern University meteoric rise from #163 to #49 on the US News and World Report list in only 17 years. The president of Northeastern University even explicitly stated that it was a top priority of the university to raise its ranking (2).\n(1) https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/3641004-the-scandal-facing-college-ranking-lists-explained/\n(2) https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/\nThese lists are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to the large impact that a college has on a student’s life, it is important to know where these rankings come from and what they actually measure. In this project, we will explore how influential different metrics are in determining a college’s ranking.\nIn general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school’s ranking on the Niche College Ranking List and determine which are most important to a high ranking. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and admission rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren’t typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.\nFor the sake of clarity, when we say a “low rank,” we are referring to schools with a lower numerical rank, such as #1 and #2. When we say a “high rank,” we a referring to schools with a high numerical rank, such as #499 and #500."

    "text": "Data\n\n\n\n\nData Set #1: Niche\n\nThe first data set comes from Niche’s “2023 Best Colleges in America” list\n(https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/)\nNiche aggregates data from a variety of sources, including the US Department of Education and reviews from students and alumni, to build their list of college rankings. The rankings list is updated monthly. However, Niche only receives data from the US Department of Education on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: college (institution name) and rank.\n\n\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data, but most of the data comes from the 2020-2021 school year. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to narrow this to 31 variables. We chose any variables that we thought would have an impact on college rank, and excluded redundant ones like specific breaksdowns of test scores. There are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\nVariable Summary\nHere is a summary of the variables we will be using in our analysis. We selected every one we thought could impact rank, but left some out, such as test score breakdowns to avoid redundancy.\nCategorical:\n\ncollege: Institution name\nREGION: US geographic region (New England, Mid East, Great Lakes, Plains, Southeast, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, Far West, Outlying Areas)\nACCREDAGENCY: Accreditor for Institution\nCONTROL: Public, Private nonprofit, or Private for-profit\nCCBASIC: Carnegie Classification (basic)\n\nNumerical\n\nADM_RATE: Admission rate\nUGDS, UGDS_WHITE, UGDS_BLACK, UGDS_HISP, UGDS_ASIAN, UGDS_AIAN, UGDS_NHPI, UGDS_2MOR, and UGDS_UNKN represent the enrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students, enrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students who are White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, two or more races, and of unknown race, respectively.\nNPT4_PUB: Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions)\nNPT4_PRIV: Average net price for Title IV institutions (private for-profit and nonprofit institutions)\nCOSTT4_A: Average cost of attendance (academic year institutions)\nCOSTT4_P: Average cost of attendance (program-year institutions)\nAVGFACSAL: Average faculty salary\nPCTPELL: Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant\nC150_4: Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion)\nAGE_ENTRY: Average age of entry\nFEMALE: Share of female students\nMARRIED: Share of married students\nFIRST_GEN: Share of first-generation students\nFAMINC: Average family income\nMD_FAMINC: Median family income\nENDOWBEGIN: Value of school’s endowment at the beginning of the fiscal year\nSAT_AVG: Average SAT equivalent score of students admitted\nACTCMMID: Midpoint of the ACT cumulative score\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\nTo get the data, we scraped from Niche.com and downloaded data from the US Department of Education, and imported. The steps were done in an R script titled niche-scrape.R\nSome of the college names were slightly different between datasets, so we had to individually change names in the Department of Education dataset to match those in the Niche one before joining the two. The Observations for University of South Florida - Sarasota-Manatee (ranked 141) and University of South Florida - St. Petersburg (ranked 181) have been dropped from the colleges data set because they do not exist in the us_dep_of_ed dataset. This is because these two universities were combined with the main University of South Florida campus. Therefore the joined colleges data set only has 498 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the categorical variables in the US Department of Education dataset (REGION, CONTROL, and CCBASIC) used numbers to represent the different levels, so we looked at the data dictionary and replaced each number with the words that it represents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the numerical variables are on different scales—for example, SAT scores can range from 400 to 1600, while admission rate can only range from 0 to 1—and so we standardized them for easier analysis and comparison. We created a scaled version of the dataset where the mean value of each numeric variable is 0, and the standard deviation 1.

    "text": "Approach #2: Stepwise Regression Modeling\nAnother method we used to answer our research question of which characteristics are most associated with university rankings is through stepwise regression model. A stepwise regression model can manage large amounts of potential predictor variables and fine-tune the model to choose the best predictor variables from the available options. In our case, we have more than 25 variables to be examined and thus it is crucial to have a automated workflow for model selections.\nIn our research, we will use both forward and backward selections in the stepwise regression model by utilizing MASS package. We will evaluate the performance of each iteration of the model based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). AIC is used to compare different possible models and determine which one is the best fit for the data in statistic practice.\nThere are two main steps in this approach.\n\nCreate a correlation matrix to check correlation coefficients between variables so as to not use similar variables in our model. If two variables had an absolute value of r greater than 0.8, meaning they were too similar in how they factored into rankings, we only picked one of them to put into the model.\nCompute the stepwise regression model using MASS package and mainly stepAIC() functions for model selections based on AIC. For the initial setting of the linear regression model, we will import all the valid variables into the model to predict the rank variable.\n\nIn the end, this will give us the best final model with much fewer variables.

    "section": "Final Variable Analysis",
    "text": "Final Variable Analysis\n\nCategorical Variable Analysis\nAll four categorical variables appeared in the final model, and therefore we can assume that they have a significant association with rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geographic Region graph shows that New England has the highest proportion of top-100 schools, while the Plains has the lowest. Apart from the New England and NA bars, the differences in proportions of rank groups do not vary dramatically between bars.\nThere does not appear to be a obvious pattern in the accreditation agency graph, which could be because some of the agencies corresponded to very few schools in the top 500. Additionally, as accreditation agency is often based on location, it reflects results similar to the region graph. However…\nThere are only 4 Private, For-profit schools in the top 500, and all of them are ranked between 301 and 400. The proportions of ranks between Private, Non-profit and Public are similar, although the first appears to have a larger proportion of 1-100 schools, and the latter a higher proportion of 401-500 schools.\nThere appear to be the greatest differences between bars of proportions of rank groups in the Carnegie Classification group, suggesting that this has the strongest association with rank. It appears that the lower the rank, the higher proportion of schools in Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity and Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus. However, the opposite appeared to be true for all other classifications with 3 or more rank categories. Like accreditation agencies, some classifications corresponded to very few schools in the top 500.\nQualitatively, it appears that region and Carnegie Classification have the clearest relationship with rank; however, the final model indicates that they all have an association with rank.\n\n\nNumerical Variable Analysis\nAll of the variables with the top 5 R-squared values appeared in the final stepwise regression model except for ACTCMMID (median ACT score) and C150_4 (graduation rate). These were not used in the model because both of them had a high correlation with SAT_AVG (average SAT). Because SAT_AVG ended up in the final model, we can reasonably assume that they also have a strong association with rank based on the model’s selection process. Therefore, we conclude that SAT_AVG, ACTCMMID, C150_4, and ADM_RATE have the strongest association with rank and we will characterize the relationship below.\nHow do these 5 metrics influence Niche college rank?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-squared, scaled slope, and un-scaled slope for linear regression models between 6 metrics and Niche College Rank\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nR-Squared\nScaled Slope\nUn-scaled Slope\n\n\n\n\nAvg.

We hypothesized that SAT/ACT scores, acceptance rate, and family income would have the strongest association with rank, and our results mostly confirm this hypothesis. SAT/ACT/Acceptance Rate were among the most correlated variables, but family income was not in the top five.\nThe clearest way to interpret these R-Squared values is the following: 63% of the variation in college rank can be explained by average SAT score. This same interpretation can be used for all of the variables.\nThese relationships indicate certain priorities in college rankings. As SAT and ACT scores are the most correlated variables and acceptance rate is in the top five, it is clear that the rankings highly prioritize selectivity in college admissions. This is logical since the audience of the rankings is mostly prospective students who are applying to college. There are obvious concerns with this approach: does it cause colleges to prioritize improving admissions selectivity over their quality of education and student outcomes? The inclusion of graduation rate and faculty salary do tell slightly different stories. Graduation rate indicates a focus on the ability of a university to meet the needs of its students and give them the resources and support. Faculty salary, in a way, may indicate the quality of the faculty both in teaching and research.\nLooking further at the relationships, there is a negative relationship between SAT/ACT/Graduation Rate/Faculty Salary and rank. This indicates that as the variables increase, the rank of the school decreases. There is a positive relationship between admission rate and rank, indicating that as this variable increases, the rank of a school increases.\nLooking at the un-scaled slope allows us to interpret how much changes in the explanatory variable change rank. For example for ACT, we can say that on average, we can expect a 1-point increase in ACT score to drop the rank of a school by 30 places. For admission rate, since it is scaled from 0-1, we need to divide the slope by 100 to get an interpretable number. It indicates that a 1-point drop in admission rate will drop the rank of the school by 3.87 places.\nLooking at the scaled slope allows us to tell which variables have the greatest “influence” on rank. In other words, which change in a numerical variable away from the mean has the greatest impact on decreasing a school’s rank? An extremely interesting trend is that among the five most associated variables, schools that have a stronger R-squared also have a higher absolute value of scaled-slope, indicating that variables that have the strongest association to rank also have the greatest influence on decreasing rank. This is logical because Niche would likely tie their rankings to variables where there is the greatest differentiation between schools with higher and lower ranks. This is also concerning because if schools know which variables are most associated to rank and which ones have the greatest impact on decreasing it, it is fairly easy for them to know which variables to change if they wanted to manipulate the rankings."

For example, the first step represents the first iteration with all the variables. Then, the variable FAMINC was removed, leading to a decrease in AIC. Then, one-by-one, it removes PCTPELL, ENDOWBEGIN, each level of undergraduate ethnicities, and female student population to continue making the best model for our data. Finally, the re-addition of UGDS_HISP led to the final iteration our of model with just 16 variables. We can tell this is the best model because its AIC value is the lowest.\n\n\nModel Results\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above visually displays the decreasing AIC value as variables get taken out and potentially re-added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\nadj.r.squared\nsigma\nstatistic\np.value\ndf\nlogLik\nAIC\nBIC\ndeviance\ndf.residual\nnobs\n\n\n\n\n0.7740974\n0.7524947\n71.92032\n35.83336\n0\n35\n-2270.33\n4614.661\n4762.529\n1893147\n366\n402\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further tell that this is our best model because it has an r-squared coefficient of 0.774. The variables here can then be considered to be the variables that affect a college’s ranking the most. Region (REGION) and type of school (CONTROL, CCBASIC) influence its ranking. There are certain qualities of its undergraduate population that are more statistically significant than others and were thus included in this model: overall undergraduate population, number of Asians, Hispanics, mixed students, and first-generation students, and average age when the undergraduated enrolled. Average SAT score was also significant enough to be include into the model, and ACCREDAGENCY and cost of attendance were also the final two variables considered significant enough for our best model."

Apart from the New England and NA bars, the differences in proportions of rank groups do not vary dramatically between bars.\nThere does not appear to be a obvious pattern in the accreditation agency graph, which could be because some of the agencies corresponded to very few schools in the top 500. Additionally, as accreditation agency is often based on location, it reflects results similar to the region graph. However…\nThere are only 4 Private, For-profit schools in the top 500, and all of them are ranked between 301 and 400. The proportions of ranks between Private, Non-profit and Public are similar, although the first appears to have a larger proportion of 1-100 schools, and the latter a higher proportion of 401-500 schools.\nThere appear to be the greatest differences between bars of proportions of rank groups in the Carnegie Classification group, suggesting that this has the strongest association with rank. It appears that the lower the rank, the higher proportion of schools in Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity and Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus. However, the opposite appeared to be true for all other classifications with 3 or more rank categories. Like accreditation agencies, some classifications corresponded to very few schools in the top 500.\nQualitatively, it appears that region and Carnegie Classification have the clearest relationship with rank; however, the final model indicates that they all have an association with rank.\n\n\nNumerical Variable Analysis\nAll of the variables with the top 5 R-squared values appeared in the final stepwise regression model except for ACTCMMID (median ACT score) and C150_4 (graduation rate). These were not used in the model because both of them had a high correlation with SAT_AVG (average SAT). Because SAT_AVG ended up in the final model, we can reasonably assume that they also have a strong association with rank based on the model’s selection process. Therefore, we conclude that SAT_AVG, ACTCMMID, C150_4, and ADM_RATE have the strongest association with rank and we will characterize the relationship below."

In fact, 98% of lemur species are endangered, and 31% of species are critically endangered nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct researches on the lifespan of lemurs to save the endangered species. Moreover, Duke Lemur Center has been the world leader in the study, care, and protection of lemurs since it was founded in 1966. As Duke students, we are able to utilize the resources at DLC to research on lemurs and potentially contribute to their studies.\nThrough our preliminary investigation, we found that the death age of lemurs varies a lot ranging from 0 to 35. Thus, we are interested in researching on what are the determining factors of lemurs’ lifespan. Our hypotheses is that taxon, sex, weight are the top 3 factors that would affect the lifespan of lemurs.\nWe plan to research on all the variables within the dataset that could potentially affect lemur’s lifespan. There are both categorical and quantitative variables involved in our research questions since categorical variables such as taxon and quantitative variables such as weight can all play a role in their lifespan."

    "text": "Research question\n\nDoes the frequency of earthquakes at a certain location have any relationship to their magnitude or significance?\nThis question is important because by determining if there are relationships between the variables, we can then consider the living conditions of people that live in those locations. There might be certain locations in which earthquakes are at their strongest and people should not be living there, or maybe locations in which we have to consider what kinds of infrastructure buildings should have to prevent them from collapsing as a result of multiple strong earthquakes.\nA rough look at the first 50 observations showed that a lot of earthquakes happened in Alaska and California. This made us wonder why this was the case and to see if those patterns are consistent throughout the rest of the data. Furthermore, because earthquakes happen more often in those states, we wonder if they are stronger than earthquakes that only occur once at a certain location and if they overall have a higher significance. Our hypothesis is that frequency and magnitude will have a positive correlation, and that the average significance of the more frequent locations will be higher than the average significance of less frequent locations.\nOur research question focuses on four variables: location, frequency, magnitude, and significance. For location, we can consider the nominal categorical variable location.name which gives us the state/country in which the earthquake occurred. We can also consider location.longitude and location.latitude which gives us the exact coordinates of an earthquake’s location, which would be continuous numerical variables. impact.magnitude displays the magnitude of an earthquake which is a continuous numerical variable. We will also consider impact.significance, which is a discrete numerical variable and gives the significance of each earthquake based on a range of factors including estimated impact, magnitude, and felt reports. Lastly, we will calculate frequency, a discrete numerical variable, based on the location data."

    "text": "Introduction and data\nTo answer our question, we want to join two data sets. Both are listed below.\nData Set #1: Niche\n\nThe first data set comes from Niche’s “2023 Best Colleges in America” list\n(https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/)\nNiche aggregates data from a variety of sources, including the US Department of Education and reviews from students and alumni, to build their list of college rankings. The rankings list is updated monthly to reflect new data that Niche receives; although, data from the US Department o Education is only received on an annual basis. The Niche data was scraped by Maia on October 17-19 2022.\nThere are 500 observations, representing the top 500 schools in the United States. Each observation has two variables: the name of the school and the rank of the school.\n\nData Set #2: US Department of Education\n\nThe second data set comes from the US Department of Education’s College Scorecard, which is an exhaustive summary of characteristics and statistics for all colleges and universities in the United States. There were 2,989 variables in the original data set, many of which we don’t need to answer our question, and since this data set was too large to load into RStudio, we used Excel to select the variables we needed to import.\n(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)\nThe College Scorecard is updated by the Education Department as it collects new data. Data used in the scorecard comes comes from data reported by the institutions, data on federal financial aid, data from taxes, and data from other federal agencies.\nThere are 6681 observations in the data set, representing all of the colleges and universities in the United States. There are 63 variables in the data set, which give information about each different school.\nThere are no obvious ethical or privacy concerns with this data. The schools did not report data on individual students but rather summary data of all students.\n\nThe Department of Education data set was left joined to Niche dataset by school name to make a new data set with 500 observations and 64 variables."

    "text": "Research question\n\nHere are three potential research questions:\n\nHow do rankings compare across different types of schools (by region, by racial makeup, by school type)?\nWhich three variable have the greatest impact on a college’s ranking?\nDo “input variables” like ACT/SAT, GPA, and type of high school matter more to a college’s ranking than “output variable” like median income and graduation rate?\n\nThese questions are important because students applying to college trust these rankings and weigh them into their college decisions. Due to large impact that a college has on a student’s life, it is important to know where these ranking come from and what they actually measure.\nIn general, we want to examine how different variables affect a school’s ranking on the Niche College Ranking List. We plan to look at variables that are typically thought to influence school rank such as average SAT score and acceptance rate, but we also want to look at variables that aren’t typically thought of such as geographic region or endowment size.\nWe hypothesize that:\n\nschools that are from the northeast, are majority-white, and are private will have higher rankings on average.\nACT/SAT test score, acceptance rate, and median earnings 10 years after graduation will have the biggest impact on college rank.\ninput variables will matter more because they are more important to students applying to college, and the ranking list is geared towards them.\n\nHere are the types of variables involved in our research questions:\n\nCategorical (nominal):\n\ncity\nstate\nzip\naccreditor institution\ncontrol (public vs. private)\nCarnegie classification\n\nNumerical (continuous):\n\nlatitude, longitude\nadmission rate\nTotal share of enrollment by racial groups\naverage net price\naverage cost of attendance\naverage faculty salary\npercentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell grant\ncompletion rate\naverage age of entry\nshare of female students\nshare of married students\nshare of first generation students\nmedian & mean family income\nmedian & mean earning 10 years after entry\nValue of school’s endowment\n\nNumerical (discrete)\n\n25th/50th/75th/mean ACT/SAT scores for sub-tests and composite\nEnrollment of undergraduate certificate/degree-seeking students"
